# Tatvasoft Summer Internship Docs 
This repository contains all my internship work and documentation.
Regularly updated with all work done during the internship.

## Configuration

This project uses `appsettings.json` for database and JWT setup.

To run the project locally:
1. Copy `appsettings.Template.json` → rename it as `appsettings.json`
2. Replace placeholders with your actual:
   - PostgreSQL username & password
   - JWT key, issuer, and audience
3. Run the project in Visual Studio 2022

DO NOT push `appsettings.json` to GitHub — it's already ignored in `.gitignore`
